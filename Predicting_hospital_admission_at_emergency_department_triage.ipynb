    "Emergency departments (ED) are the hospitals' areas where it is provided treatment for patients with severe illnesses and life-threatening injuries 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Patients of all ages and a nearly infinite variety of conditions and degrees of illness can require attention in emergency rooms and the approach to treatment in an emergency department can vary dramatically from case to case, even for the same medical condition. Emergency departments are places with high-level pressure and are fast-paced. EDs often become overcrowded due to the variety of complaints and injuries they have to deal with, which can be quite complex. Despite the fact that the majority of patients are discharged from the emergency department, it usually is the primary source of hospital admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triage is one of the most common tools used to improve ED operational performance. It is utilized to sort incoming patients into groups according to their urgency level. There are several tools/scales developed in order to assist the health provider to categorize the patient. Typically, a nurse does the first evaluation based on various factors, including demographics, chief complaints, and vital signs, in order to carry out triage. Once is triaged, the patient is examined by a physician, who evaluates the patient disposition: admitted or discharged. However, the described process tends to highly depend on the medical provider’s knowledge and experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of optimizing the process of triage and admission of a patient in the emergency department:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patients: better opportunity, safety and satisfaction. Reduce complications, adverse events, patient morbidity and mortality.\n",
    "- Healthcare providers: support in decision making and not only to emergency professionals, prediction could help primary health services to define if the patient needs to consult the emergency room.\n",
    "- Hospitals management: support decision-making regarding resources management, patient flow, and healthcare spending. Improve indicators like stay length, readmission rates, and support protocol definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With hospitals increasing adoption of electronic health records and data warehousing, it has been easier to apply statistical models to improve healthcare processes. Many groups have done predictive models to apply to admission disposition in emergency departments.\n",

    "Demographics: included age, gender, primary language, ethnicity, employment status, insurance status, marital status, and religion. The primary language variable was recoded into a binary split (e.g., English vs. non-English), while the top twelve levels comprising >95% of all visits were retained for the religion variable and all other levels binned to one 'Other' category. All unique levels were retained for other demographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triage evaluation: included variables routinely collected at triage, such as the name of presenting hospital, arrival time (month, day, 4-hr bin), arrival method, triage vital signs, and ESI (emergency severity index) level assigned by the triage nurse. Triage vital signs included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, presence of oxygen device, and temperature. Values beyond physiologic limits were replaced with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chief complaint: the top 200 most frequent values, which comprised >90% of all visits, were retained as unique categories and all other values binned into 'Other'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital usage statistic: This include the number of ED visits within one year, the number of admissions within one year, the disposition of the patient's previous ED visit, and the number of procedures and surgeries listed in the patient's record at the time of encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past medical history: 281 clinically meaningful categories according the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classification Software (CCS), each CCS category became a binary variable with the value 1 if the patient's past medical history contained one or more ICD-9 code belonging in that category and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outpatient medications: binned into 48 therapeutic subgroups (e.g. cardiovascular, analgesics), each corresponding variable representing the number of medications in that subgroup, the medication should be active in the moment of the triage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical vitals: A time-frame of one year from the date of patient encounter was used to calculate historical information, which included vital signs, labs and imaging previously ordered from any of the three EDs. **Historical vital signs were represented by the minimum, maximum, median, and the last recorded value of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, presence of oxygen device, and temperature. Values beyond physiologic limits were replaced with missing values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical labs: Given the diversity of labs ordered within the ED, the 150 most frequent labs comprising 94% of all orders were extracted then divided into labs with numeric values and those with categorical values. The cutoff of 150 was chosen to include labs ordered commonly enough to be significant in the management of most patients (e.g., Troponin T, BNP, CK, D-Dimer), even if they were not as frequent as routine labs like CBC, BMP, and urinalysis. The minimum, maximum, median, and the last recorded value of each numeric lab were included as features. Categorical labs, which included urinalysis and culture results, were recoded into binary variables with 1 for any positive value (e.g. positive, trace, +, large) and 0 otherwise. Any growth in blood culture was labeled positive as were urine cultures with > 49,000 colonies/mL. The number of tests, the number of positives, and the last recorded value of each categorical lab were included as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging and EKG counts: The number of orders were counted for each of the following categories: electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray, other x-ray, echocardiogram, other ultrasound, head CT, other CT, MRI, and all other imaging.\n"

    "Depending on the type of information and number of unique values (and the distributions) we have a few options to encode these columns numerically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _binarize_: map all the values to 0s and 1s, this might involve mapping together multiple categories (rolling up categories).\n",
    "- _ordinal encoding_: this can be used when there is a sequential order or scale associated with your categories, and we can map the categories to a list of numbers.\n",
    "    - `education`: could map it to a scale, could binarize, we can test different approaches and it would change the model interpretation and performance. \n",
    "- _cyclical encoding_: this can account for a periodic structure in your data (like the cyclical repetition of weekdays, hour of the day, degrees and angles, month of year, etc). We can map the categories to points on a circle and use the x/y coordinates (sin and cos) to get a numeric representation. In many cases, the interpretation is so difficult that its not worth the trouble unless your only goal is increase model performance.\n",
    "- _dummy variables_ / _one-hot encoding_: its a way of mapping each category in a single field into a new 0/1 column, marking it that value was present. So 5 unique values will add 5 new columns for your data set and each row will exactly have one 1 in it marking the original category in that row.\n",
    "    - this is the ideal choice if you would like to deal with independent categories or you would like to disregard any sequential ordering\n",
    "    - we need to be careful with high unique counts as we can introduce too many of these 0/1 columns and introduce multicollinearity\n",
    "    - you can always calculate a single dummy column value from the rest, so we select a _reference category_ and drop that."
